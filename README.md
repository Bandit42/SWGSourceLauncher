SWGSource Game Launcher by Bandit aka Aphe Cloudstryder (Flurry)

Changelog v0.1

Initial Upload of Launcher Project


Welcome to the SWGSource Launcher Project. This project is OPEN SOURCE with a couple of rules:
1. Please be sure to give credit where credit is due to those who have contributed to the project and those that have provided assistance to this project.

2. This project is still a work in progress and with my limited experience, I can only do so much to make this project work presently and in the future and due to that, this project was created by following a video tutorial. This project could use a lot of help and skills from experienced programers/coders, etc who have done game launcher projects like this before. Don't be afraid to dive in and see what you can do for the project.

3. Join our SWGSource discord at: https://discord.gg/Va8e6n8
4. And last but not least, our SWGSource Wiki Link: https://github.com/SWG-Source/swg-main/wiki
I would like to thank Tekaoh from SWGSource for giving me some ideas and testing out the launcher.
I would also like to thank the crew at SWGSource for all the hard work they are doing to re-build a game that6 everyone loved and enjoyed so much.

When it comes to the webbrowser on the launcher, you will also ahve to create an html page and host that page to get the browser to display the html page content.
You will need Visual Studio 2019 Community (free)
You will also need to Visual Studio Code (for webpage development for webbrowser within launcher).
You need tghe following NuGet. Both are wrappers for the launcher:
Awesomium (recommended)
CefSharp

Enjoy this project and May the Force be with you, Always!!!!

Things this project could use:
A file checker to check for corrupt files
An updater and game version control to download updated client files from your hosted client files
Install/file checker progress bar with filename progress
Any Future Suggestions for the launcher are greatly appreciated.
